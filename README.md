# PasswordFetcher
Stealthy password fetcher for windows

# USAGE
All one has to do is plug in the USB Drive in any available USB port 
on any windows machine, an autorun prompt will pop-up. 
The first option should say Open Drive. Once clicked the password fetcher 
dumps all the browser passwords in a passwords folder on the USB Drive. 
The process is relatively quick and most users are likey to miss it.

Once the passwords are dumped the USB drive is then unplugged and connected 
to my machine to view using [KeePass]( https://keepass.info/).

***As a bonus this can be used to transport all browser saved passwords to a 
password manager for better safe keeping and then delete all saved passwords 
from the browser(s).***
